# cookieCutter

A platform that allows users discover and understand new recipes written in an intuitive and visual flowchart. Cooks can build a visual recipe using click&drag blocks, share it, compare it to other recipes side-by-side, and if you like the recipe, then you can click&drag the parts you want to borrow upon which you can build you own recipe! This app was created using AngularJS, ui-tree, Mongoose, MongoDB, and ExpressJS for a JSON api.
